Understanding taxi usage

Which neighborhoods are better served by taxis? How this correlates with the median household income per neighborhood ?

How does taxi density vary over time? During the day? On weekdays vs. weekends and holidays?

Are there regions where the taxi density is always high (or low)?

What are the most popular destinations? Do these change over time? For example, summer vs the other seasons?

What are the most popular trips (source, destination)?

Is the number of trips and taxis affected by weather? E.g., are there fewer cabs when it is raining/snowing?

Are revenues affected during major events? E.g., parades, presidential visits, storms
